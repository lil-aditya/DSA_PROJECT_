--- Simulation Setup ---
Network graph created.
Address book populated with Admin and UserA public keys.
Node inboxes (priority queues) created.

--- Simulation 1: Valid URGENT Packet ---
Path found: 0 1 3 5 
Sending packet from Node 0 to Node 1...

--- Node 1 Processing ---
Popped packet: pkt_admin_01 (Urgency: 20) from Admin
Packet Data: "REBOOT_SERVER_COMMAND"
Signature: VALID. Packet is trusted.
Forwarding packet to next hop: Node 3

--- Node 3 Processing ---
Popped packet: pkt_admin_01 (Urgency: 20) from Admin
Packet Data: "REBOOT_SERVER_COMMAND"
Signature: VALID. Packet is trusted.
Forwarding packet to next hop: Node 5

--- Node 5 Processing ---
Popped packet: pkt_admin_01 (Urgency: 20) from Admin
Packet Data: "REBOOT_SERVER_COMMAND"
Signature: VALID. Packet is trusted.
Packet DELIVERED to final destination (Node 5).

--- Simulation 2: Tampered LOW_PRIORITY Packet ---
An attacker intercepts the packet and changes its data...
Path found: 0 2 4 
Sending tampered packet from Node 0 to Node 2...

--- Node 2 Processing ---
Popped packet: pkt_user_02 (Urgency: 5) from UserA
Packet Data: "MALICIOUS_DATA_INJECTED"
Signature: INVALID. Packet is spoofed or corrupt. DROPPING.
